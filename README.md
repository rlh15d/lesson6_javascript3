### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that the statement "var lastFigure = document.createElement("figure");" creates a new figure element and assign it to the variable name lastFigure.
2. I learned that the "addEventListener()" function attaches the event handler to the specified element, and when clicked the event handler function is executed.
3. I learned that the use of the "appendChild()" method is to add the document fragment to the DOM tree for the document, as a child of the article element.
